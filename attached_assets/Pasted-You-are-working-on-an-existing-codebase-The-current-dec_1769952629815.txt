You are working on an existing codebase.
	•	The current decision engine is GOOD and FUNCTIONAL
	•	Strategies, factors, thresholds, and regime logic already exist
	•	DO NOT remove, rename, or rewrite existing strategies
	•	DO NOT add new factors unless explicitly instructed
	•	Goal is to slightly rebalance and clarify decision weightage so users get:
	◦	Clear WHY (Strategic)
	◦	Clear WHEN (Tactical)
Think in terms of signal emphasis, not feature expansion.

🎯 OBJECTIVE
Improve the clarity and directionality of the existing decision engine by:
	1	Slightly increasing the influence of:
	◦	Fundamentals in Strategic horizon
	◦	Technical + Events in Tactical horizon
	2	Introducing a light Integrity & Event Gate (non-breaking)
	3	Making Tactical vs Strategic intent more obvious to users
	4	Keeping all existing scores, statuses, and rankings intact
This is a calibration pass, not a redesign.

🧠 DESIGN PRINCIPLE (IMPORTANT)
	•	Strategic horizon answers: “WHY should I own this?”
	•	Tactical horizon answers: “WHEN should I act?”
Use this principle when adjusting weight influence.

🟢 STEP 1 — ADD A LIGHT INTEGRITY & EVENT GATE (NON-DESTRUCTIVE)
Purpose
Improve user trust by clearly signaling binary risk, without blocking existing logic.
Add (new utility, optional use):

server/domain/risk/integrityAudit.ts
Checks (NO NEW DATA SOURCES)
	•	Trend status (already available)
	•	Earnings proximity (existing event proximity logic)
	•	Manual newsRisk boolean (placeholder)
Behavior
	•	If earnings < 5 days OR newsRisk = true:
	◦	Add a Binary Risk Flag
	◦	Display warning in UI
	•	Tactical engine:
	◦	Apply additional penalty (-5 to -10), NOT a hard block
	•	Strategic engine:
	◦	Flag only, no score penalty
⚠️ Do NOT override or remove existing event proximity scoring This is an overlay, not a replacement.

🟢 STEP 2 — STRATEGIC ENGINE (4–9 MONTHS): EMPHASIZE “WHY”
Goal
Slightly increase fundamental conviction without breaking current factor math.
Current Strategic Factors (KEEP ALL)
	•	Risk & Portfolio Guardrails
	•	Macro Alignment
	•	Institutional Signals
	•	Fundamental Acceleration
	•	Weekly Technical Structure
	•	Time-Based Thesis Decay
Required Adjustment (SUBTLE)
A. Increase Fundamental Influence
	•	Increase Fundamental Acceleration effective influence by ~10–15%
	◦	Do NOT change raw point caps
	◦	Apply a small multiplier internally (e.g. ×1.1)
B. Technical = Confirmation, Not Driver
	•	Weekly Technical Structure:
	◦	Continue to contribute
	◦	But cap its downside penalty so strong fundamentals are not fully negated
C. Output Messaging (IMPORTANT)
Expose labels in result:
	•	“Fundamental Conviction: High / Medium / Low”
	•	“Technical Alignment: Confirming / Neutral / Weak”
No new scores required — derive from existing factor percentages.

🟢 STEP 3 — TACTICAL ENGINE (0–4 MONTHS): EMPHASIZE “WHEN”
Goal
Make Tactical scores feel timing-sensitive, not thesis-driven.
Current Tactical Factors (KEEP ALL)
	•	Multi-Timeframe Technical Alignment
	•	Momentum Regime
	•	Liquidity & Volume Triggers
	•	Sentiment & Options Context
	•	Event Proximity
	•	Time Stop Logic
	•	Opportunity Ranking
Required Adjustment
A. Increase Technical + Event Sensitivity
	•	Slightly increase influence of:
	◦	Multi-Timeframe Technical Alignment
	◦	Momentum Regime
	◦	Event Proximity
	•	Practical effect:
	◦	Strong technicals should visibly lift Tactical score
	◦	Near earnings should more clearly suppress Tactical score
B. Fundamentals = Filter Only
	•	Do NOT remove fundamentals
	•	Ensure fundamentals:
	◦	Prevent bad trades
	◦	Do NOT meaningfully boost Tactical score
C. Output Messaging
Expose labels:
	•	“Technical Setup: Strong / Developing / Weak”
	•	“Event Risk: Near / Clear”

🟢 STEP 4 — MAKE STRATEGIC VS TACTICAL DIFFERENCE OBVIOUS
UI / Output Clarity (No UI redesign required)
Ensure final output communicates:
	•	Strategic score = Ownership quality
	•	Tactical score = Action readiness
If both scores are high:
	•	Label as “High Conviction + Actionable”
If Strategic high / Tactical low:
	•	Label as “Strong Business – Wait for Setup”
If Tactical high / Strategic low:
	•	Label as “Short-Term Opportunity Only”
These are labels only, no new logic needed.

🚫 STRICT DO-NOTs
	•	❌ Do NOT change regime logic
	•	❌ Do NOT add new external data
	•	❌ Do NOT delete existing factors
	•	❌ Do NOT merge Strategic & Tactical logic
	•	❌ Do NOT inflate scores artificially

✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA
	•	Existing engine continues to work
	•	Scores feel more intuitive and directional
	•	Users clearly understand:
	◦	WHY a stock is good
	◦	WHEN it is actionable
	•	No assumptions added
	•	Code remains Phase-3 ready

🧠 FINAL GUIDANCE TO AGENT
This task is about clarity and emphasis, not complexity. Prefer small, intentional adjustments over large rewrites.
