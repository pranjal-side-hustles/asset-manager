ROLE

You are a senior product + frontend engineer polishing an existing, working stock-analysis system.

DO NOT change any scoring, thresholds, or evaluation logic.
Your job is to make decisions explainable, transparent, and confidence-aware.

OBJECTIVES (PHASE 1 POLISH)

Add:

Clear “Why Trade / Why Watch / Why Avoid” explanations

Market regime impact transparency

Confidence signaling

UX affordances to explore decisions

Visual consistency & clarity

This phase is about trust, not new features.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

❌ Do NOT change evaluator logic

❌ Do NOT change thresholds

❌ Do NOT add new indicators

❌ Do NOT refactor domain code

Only presentation + explanation layers.

1️⃣ PER-STOCK EXPLAINABILITY PANEL (CRITICAL)
Where

Each stock card (Strategic + Tactical sections)

What to add

A collapsible “Why?” section for each horizon.

Strategic – “Why Watch / Reject”

Show:

Top positive factors (from positives[])

Top risks (from risks[])

Primary failure mode

Market regime impact (explicit)

Example UI copy:

Why WATCH?
• Strong fundamentals, but market regime is Risk-Off
• Weekly trend intact, no clean breakout yet
• Institutional activity neutral

Main Risk:
• Broad market below 200DMA

Tactical – “Why Trade / Watch / Avoid”

Show:

Entry quality highlights

Momentum / volume confirmation

Immediate risks

Event proximity (if available)

Example:

Why TRADE?
• Strong short-term momentum
• Relative strength vs SPY
• No earnings in next 10 days

Risk:
• Market volatility elevated

2️⃣ REGIME IMPACT BADGE (VERY IMPORTANT)
Add a small badge next to each status

Examples:

🟡 “WATCH (Regime Headwind)”

🟢 “TRADE (Despite Risk-Off)”

🔴 “AVOID (Structure Broken)”

This prevents users from thinking:

“Why is everything yellow?”

3️⃣ CONFIDENCE INDICATOR

Use existing confidence metadata (do NOT invent new logic).

Display:

High / Medium / Low confidence

Tooltip explaining:

Data completeness

Regime certainty

Signal alignment

Example:

Confidence: Medium
• Market regime mixed
• Breadth estimated
• All stock signals present

4️⃣ DASHBOARD SUMMARY POLISH

Enhance the top summary cards:

Add:

Short subtitle text under counts

Example:

Trade Eligible (6)
Short-term momentum setups

On Watch (8)
Structurally strong, waiting for confirmation

Avg Strategic (54)
Cautious market environment

Avg Tactical (66)
Selective opportunities available

This gives narrative context.

5️⃣ VISUAL CONSISTENCY REFINEMENTS
Status colors (keep exactly these semantics)

🟢 Green → Trade / Eligible

🟡 Yellow → Watch

🔴 Red → Reject / Avoid

Small improvements

Progress bars should:

Match status color

Animate subtly on load

Icons should be consistent across cards

6️⃣ “VIEW REGIME ANALYSIS” EXPANDER

You already show:

“View regime analysis (3 factors)”

Expand this to show:

Index trend summary

Breadth explanation

Volatility explanation

Plain-English conclusion

Example:

Market is Risk-Off because:
• 3/4 indices below 200DMA
• Only 40% of stocks above long-term trend
• Volatility elevated

Implication:
• Tactical trades favored
• Strategic patience required

7️⃣ EMPTY-STATE & EDGE-CASE UX

Handle cases gracefully:

No Trade-Eligible stocks

Low confidence market

Missing data

Never show:

Blank sections

“undefined”

Raw numbers without explanation

8️⃣ FINAL UX QUALITY BAR

The app should feel like:

“A professional decision system that explains itself.”

A user should never ask:

“Why is this Watch?”

“Why is this Trade?”

“Is this because of the market?”

Because the UI answers it.

FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST

After this polish:

Decisions are explainable

Regime impact is visible

Yellow ≠ confusing

Users trust the system even when it says “wait”
