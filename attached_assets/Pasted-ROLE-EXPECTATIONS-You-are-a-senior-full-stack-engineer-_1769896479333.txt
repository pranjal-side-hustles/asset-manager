ROLE & EXPECTATIONS

You are a senior full-stack engineer and product architect.

Your task is to build a production-ready stock analysis web application called:

Deep Dive Stock OS

This is NOT a demo or tutorial project.
Design it so it can scale in features, strategies, and data sources.

The app must run entirely inside Replit.

CORE TECH STACK (MANDATORY)

Next.js (App Router ONLY)

TypeScript (strict mode)

Tailwind CSS

Server Components by default

Client Components only where interactivity is required

No Pages Router

No Vite

No CRA

No legacy patterns

PRODUCT GOAL

Deep Dive Stock OS evaluates stocks using two independent trading horizons:

Strategic Growth Anchor (4–9 months)

Tactical Sentinel (0–4 months)

Each horizon:

Uses its own logic

Produces a Score (0–100)

Produces a Trade Status

Explains WHY / WHY NOT

Is expandable in the future (more strategies later)

This app should feel like an operating system for stock decisions, not a screener.

DESIGN & UX REQUIREMENTS
Visual Style

Light theme by default

Clean, modern, minimal

Plenty of white space

Subtle card-based layout

Professional (not flashy)

Color Coding (MANDATORY)

Use consistent semantic colors:

🟢 Green → Trade Eligible / Strong Positive

🟡 Orange / Yellow → Caution / Mixed Signals / Watch

🔴 Red → Avoid / High Risk / Failing Criteria

Colors must be:

Soft

Accessible

Easy to override via Tailwind config

HIGH-LEVEL APP STRUCTURE
Routes
/                → Dashboard (overview)
/stocks/[symbol] → Stock Deep Dive (MSFT, AAPL, etc.)

REQUIRED FOLDER STRUCTURE (IMPORTANT)

Design the project so new strategies, data sources, and UI modules can be added without refactoring.

DO NOT mix domain logic with UI components.
All scoring and decision logic must live in domain/.

STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
Horizon Engines

Implement two independent evaluation engines:

1️⃣ Strategic Growth Anchor Engine

Evaluates:

Risk & portfolio guardrails

Market & volatility regime

Macro alignment

Institutional signals

Fundamental acceleration

Weekly technical structure

Time-based thesis decay

Output:

{
  score: number; // 0–100
  status: "ELIGIBLE" | "WATCH" | "REJECT";
  positives: string[];
  risks: string[];
  failureMode: string;
}

2️⃣ Tactical Sentinel Engine

Evaluates:

Multi-timeframe technical alignment

Momentum regime

Liquidity & volume triggers

Sentiment & options context

Event proximity

Time stop logic

Opportunity ranking

Output:

{
  score: number;
  status: "TRADE" | "WATCH" | "AVOID";
  entryQuality: string[];
  risks: string[];
  failureTrigger: string;
}

UI REQUIREMENTS FOR /stocks/[symbol]

The stock page must include:

1️⃣ Stock Header

Symbol

Company name (placeholder ok)

Price (mock data allowed initially)

Change indicator

2️⃣ Horizon Panels (Side-by-Side or Stacked)

Each horizon panel must show:

Score (large, prominent)

Status badge (green/yellow/red)

Expandable sections:

Positives

Risks

Failure Mode / Trigger

“Explore More” toggle for deeper details

3️⃣ UX DETAILS

Collapsible sections (clean animations)

Tooltips for advanced terms

Consistent spacing

Easily skinnable styles

DATA RULES (IMPORTANT)

Mock data is acceptable initially

Data fetching must be abstracted so:

APIs can be swapped later

Multiple providers can be added

Never hardcode MSFT logic

Symbol must be fully dynamic

NON-NEGOTIABLE ENGINEERING RULES

No any types

No business logic in React components

No inline calculations in JSX

All thresholds configurable

All engines testable in isolation

Keep everything future-proof

FUTURE-READINESS (DESIGN FOR THIS)

The architecture must allow easy addition of:

More horizons

Options strategies

Portfolio-level dashboards

Alerts & notifications

Backtesting modules

Do NOT optimize for speed over correctness.

FINAL INSTRUCTION

Build the app cleanly, incrementally, and correctly.

If something is unclear:

Make a reasonable professional assumption

Document it clearly in comments

This app should feel like:

“A serious decision system built by someone who actually trades.”
