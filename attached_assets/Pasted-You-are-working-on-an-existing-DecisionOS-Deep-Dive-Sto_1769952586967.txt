You are working on an existing DecisionOS / Deep Dive Stock OS codebase.

The current decision engine is GOOD and FUNCTIONAL

Strategies, factors, thresholds, and regime logic already exist

DO NOT remove, rename, or rewrite existing strategies

DO NOT add new factors unless explicitly instructed

Goal is to slightly rebalance and clarify decision weightage so users get:

Clear WHY (Strategic)

Clear WHEN (Tactical)

Think in terms of signal emphasis, not feature expansion.

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Improve the clarity and directionality of the existing decision engine by:

Slightly increasing the influence of:

Fundamentals in Strategic horizon

Technical + Events in Tactical horizon

Introducing a light Integrity & Event Gate (non-breaking)

Making Tactical vs Strategic intent more obvious to users

Keeping all existing scores, statuses, and rankings intact

This is a calibration pass, not a redesign.

🧠 DESIGN PRINCIPLE (IMPORTANT)

Strategic horizon answers: “WHY should I own this?”

Tactical horizon answers: “WHEN should I act?”

Use this principle when adjusting weight influence.

🟢 STEP 1 — ADD A LIGHT INTEGRITY & EVENT GATE (NON-DESTRUCTIVE)
Purpose

Improve user trust by clearly signaling binary risk, without blocking existing logic.

Add (new utility, optional use):
server/domain/risk/integrityAudit.ts

Checks (NO NEW DATA SOURCES)

Trend status (already available)

Earnings proximity (existing event proximity logic)

Manual newsRisk boolean (placeholder)

Behavior

If earnings < 5 days OR newsRisk = true:

Add a Binary Risk Flag

Display warning in UI

Tactical engine:

Apply additional penalty (-5 to -10), NOT a hard block

Strategic engine:

Flag only, no score penalty

⚠️ Do NOT override or remove existing event proximity scoring
This is an overlay, not a replacement.

🟢 STEP 2 — STRATEGIC ENGINE (4–9 MONTHS): EMPHASIZE “WHY”
Goal

Slightly increase fundamental conviction without breaking current factor math.

Current Strategic Factors (KEEP ALL)

Risk & Portfolio Guardrails

Macro Alignment

Institutional Signals

Fundamental Acceleration

Weekly Technical Structure

Time-Based Thesis Decay

Required Adjustment (SUBTLE)
A. Increase Fundamental Influence

Increase Fundamental Acceleration effective influence by ~10–15%

Do NOT change raw point caps

Apply a small multiplier internally (e.g. ×1.1)

B. Technical = Confirmation, Not Driver

Weekly Technical Structure:

Continue to contribute

But cap its downside penalty so strong fundamentals are not fully negated

C. Output Messaging (IMPORTANT)

Expose labels in result:

“Fundamental Conviction: High / Medium / Low”

“Technical Alignment: Confirming / Neutral / Weak”

No new scores required — derive from existing factor percentages.

🟢 STEP 3 — TACTICAL ENGINE (0–4 MONTHS): EMPHASIZE “WHEN”
Goal

Make Tactical scores feel timing-sensitive, not thesis-driven.

Current Tactical Factors (KEEP ALL)

Multi-Timeframe Technical Alignment

Momentum Regime

Liquidity & Volume Triggers

Sentiment & Options Context

Event Proximity

Time Stop Logic

Opportunity Ranking

Required Adjustment
A. Increase Technical + Event Sensitivity

Slightly increase influence of:

Multi-Timeframe Technical Alignment

Momentum Regime

Event Proximity

Practical effect:

Strong technicals should visibly lift Tactical score

Near earnings should more clearly suppress Tactical score

B. Fundamentals = Filter Only

Do NOT remove fundamentals

Ensure fundamentals:

Prevent bad trades

Do NOT meaningfully boost Tactical score

C. Output Messaging

Expose labels:

“Technical Setup: Strong / Developing / Weak”

“Event Risk: Near / Clear”

🟢 STEP 4 — MAKE STRATEGIC VS TACTICAL DIFFERENCE OBVIOUS
UI / Output Clarity (No UI redesign required)

Ensure final output communicates:

Strategic score = Ownership quality

Tactical score = Action readiness

If both scores are high:

Label as “High Conviction + Actionable”

If Strategic high / Tactical low:

Label as “Strong Business – Wait for Setup”

If Tactical high / Strategic low:

Label as “Short-Term Opportunity Only”

These are labels only, no new logic needed.

🚫 STRICT DO-NOTs

❌ Do NOT change regime logic

❌ Do NOT add new external data

❌ Do NOT delete existing factors

❌ Do NOT merge Strategic & Tactical logic

❌ Do NOT inflate scores artificially

✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Existing engine continues to work

Scores feel more intuitive and directional

Users clearly understand:

WHY a stock is good

WHEN it is actionable

No assumptions added

Code remains Phase-3 ready

🧠 FINAL GUIDANCE TO AGENT

This task is about clarity and emphasis, not complexity.
Prefer small, intentional adjustments over large rewrites.
